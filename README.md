# SquidBOT

A Discord moderation and music bot for SquidKIDS, the official Discord Server for Geometry Dash player and content creator Squidel.

### Setup

First, rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`. Populate the information. Then install everything in `requirements.txt` using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (I recommend doing it in a virtual environment). Then run `main.py` by using `python main.py`.

*This README is unfinished! If you can improve it, I would very much appreciate it.*
